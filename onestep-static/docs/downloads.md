  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start with metadata:</strong> Check the metadata section in each file for context</li>
    <li><strong>Validate data:</strong> Always validate data types and handle missing values</li>
    <li><strong>Join datasets:</strong> Use IDs to join related datasets (e.g., student ID, project ID)</li>
    <li><strong>Time series:</strong> Use date fields for temporal analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Network analysis:</strong> Combine students, supervisors, and projects for network graphs</li>
  </ul>
